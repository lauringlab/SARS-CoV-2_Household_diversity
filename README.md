- Data
    -- Epiweek_sampling : input data and results for calculating the proportion of cases sequenced in each state per week. Data anaylsis was completed using methods from Alpert et al. 2021 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421004347) 
    -- Family_consensus_sequences : consensus sequences from families used in this paper.
    -- Household_Trees : Trees from Usher analyses
    -- Intrahost_Variants 
- References : Contains reference files necessary for creating consensus sequences and variant calling
- Scripts
    -- Primary_analyses : Scripts for creating consensus sequences and variant calling
    -- Secondary_analysis : Scripts for making figures and within-host variant analyses
